Software
To start out we'll need to get some software installed to talk to the DE0-Nano. Unfortunately the cd's that come with the board don't work with linux out of the box. Fortunately we can download them online.

I began looking for the software following this gude: http://www.local-guru.net/blog/2011/9/25/Using-the-terasic-DE0-Nano-on-ubuntu. It looks like the download for version 15 will be about 5.5 GB downloaded. That's before an install... This is going to take a while to download on slower connections. On top of that their download manager doesn't seem to work with chrome on my Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 install.

1. Download the software for linux at https://www.altera.com/download/dnl-index.jsp. Unfortunately you will need to create an account.

2. Wait a while if you have a slow connection.

3. Move the Quartus-web-15.0.0.145-linux.tar file to a new directory you'll be working out of.

4. Unzip the tar: tar-xvf Quartus-web-15.0.0.145-linux.tar

5.
